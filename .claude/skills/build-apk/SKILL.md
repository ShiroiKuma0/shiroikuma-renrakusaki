description: Build the signed foss release APK with the buildFoss Gradle task, then always ask whether to push it to the connected phone via adb. Use whenever the user asks to build the app, build the APK, make a release build, or build and push to the phone.

# Build the foss release APK and optionally push to phone

> **Never run `adb install` (or `pm install`).** The build step may copy the APK
> to the phone with `adb push` — and only after confirming with the user — but
> **the user installs the APK themselves** from the phone's file manager. Do not
> install it for them under any circumstances.

## Steps

1. **Note the output filename.** Read the current version and build number:
   - `grep -E 'VERSION_NAME|BUILD_NUMBER' gradle.properties`
   - The APK will be `shiroikuma-renrakusaki_<VERSION_NAME>+<BUILD_NUMBER>_arm64-v8a.apk`, using the `BUILD_NUMBER` value **before** the build (the task bumps it afterward).

2. **Build (JDK 17+ required):**
   - `JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64 ./gradlew buildFoss < /dev/null`
   - The `JAVA_HOME` prefix is required: AGP 9.x needs JDK 17+, but the default `java` on this machine is 11. The `< /dev/null` guarantees it never blocks on stdin — see caveat.
   - This runs `assembleFossRelease`, copies the signed APK to `~/tmp/<apk name>`, and auto-increments `BUILD_NUMBER` in `gradle.properties`.
   - The task prints `>>> ~/tmp/<apk name>`; use that line to confirm the exact filename, and confirm `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`.

3. **Always ask** (via AskUserQuestion) whether to push the APK to the phone — every build, no assuming. Options: "Yes, push via adb" / "No, just build". This is a **push** (file copy), never an install.

4. **If yes, push the file directly yourself** (do NOT rely on the buildFoss task's own prompt — see caveat). Push only — **never `adb install`**:
   - `adb devices` — confirm a device is connected.
   - `adb shell mkdir -p /sdcard/tmp`
   - `adb push ~/tmp/<apk name> /sdcard/tmp/<apk name>`
   - Verify: `adb shell ls -l /sdcard/tmp/<apk name>` (size should match the local file in `~/tmp`).
   - Then tell the user it's at `/sdcard/tmp/<apk name>` and stop — they install it themselves.

## Caveat — why push directly instead of via the task

The `buildFoss` task (`app/build.gradle.kts`) has an interactive `read -p "Push to phone? (y/n)"` prompt, but it runs in a subprocess of the **Gradle daemon**, whose stdin/stdout are not connected to Claude's Bash tool. Piping `y`/`n` into `./gradlew buildFoss` does not reach the prompt — the daemon subprocess gets EOF, silently skips the push, and its output is invisible. So the task's prompt is effectively dead under this tooling: ask the user via AskUserQuestion and run `adb push` yourself.

## Signing

Release signing is non-interactive: `app/build.gradle.kts` reads credentials from `keystore.properties` (falling back to `SIGNING_*` env vars). If neither is present the build is unsigned and the APK will not install. The keystore lives at `~/.android-keystores/shiroikuma-renrakusaki.jks` (alias `renrakusaki`); `keystore.properties` is gitignored.
